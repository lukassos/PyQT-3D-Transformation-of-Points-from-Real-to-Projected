PyQT-3D-Transformation-of-Points-from-Real-to-Projected
=======================================================

Transforms set of real points into set of projected points coordinate system by rotating and translating them. Takes two sets of points from file input eg. export fromExcel into *.txt. Used least squared aproximation or three points to calculate transformation between theese two point sets. Afterwards the second set of points is transformed into coordinate system of the first ones points. Interface in PyQT, calculations by numpy and based on Python 3.4.
